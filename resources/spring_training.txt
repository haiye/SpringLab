JavaBean and spring bean is different

Java Beans: At a basic level, JavaBeans are simply Java classes which adhere to certain coding conventions. For example, classes that
	Have a public default (no argument) constructor
	allows access to properties using accessor (getter and setter) methods
	Implement java.io.Serializable
Spring Beans: A Spring bean is basically an object managed by Spring. More specifically, it is an object that is instantiated, configured and otherwise "managed by a Spring Framework container". Spring beans are defined in a Spring configuration file (or, more recently, by using annotations), instantiated by the Spring container, and then injected into your application.

Note that Spring Beans need not to be Java Beans always. Spring Beans may not implement java.io.Serializable Interface, can have arguments in constructor etc.
